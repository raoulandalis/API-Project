Valbnb is a Valorant-themed Airbnb clone. A new user is able to create spots (based off maps from Valorant) that they are hosting. The user can also add reviews to spots that they've recently visited but I adding star ratings and what they thought of their stay!

Valbnb is anticipating more features very soon.

Technologies used for this project are: Express, Sequelize, SQLAlchemy, JavaScript, React, HTML5, CSS3, Redux, PostgreSQL, GitHub.
